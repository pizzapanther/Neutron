# What is Pipenv?

https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The new officially recommended Python packaging tool from Python.org

It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important Pipfile.lock, which is used to produce deterministic builds.
