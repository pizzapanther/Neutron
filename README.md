# PizzaPanther's Monolithic Repository

I got tired of having a bunch of repositories so I figured I'd try the whole monolithic repo approach. If it works for big companies like Google, it should work for me right?

## Open Source Libraries

- [Zen of Django](https://github.com/pizzapanther/pizzapanther.github.io/tree/master/libs/djzen): Tools for simplifing Django
- [PBKDF2 Helpers](https://github.com/pizzapanther/pizzapanther.github.io/tree/master/libs/pbkdf2-helpers): Helper functions for implementing PBKDF2 password storage in Node.JS.
