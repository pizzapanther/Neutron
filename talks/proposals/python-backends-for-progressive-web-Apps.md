# Python Backends for Progressive Web Apps

Progressive Web Apps are a new set of browser technologies that make web apps faster, more reliable, and more engaging. While a lot of what makes PWAs is based in frontend engineering, your Python backend will be needed to support many of these new features. In this talk we will explore what makes up a Progressive Web App and then dive into techniques in Python used to support them. Specifially we'll look at the following areas:

- building APIs for frontend engineers
- building and caching frontend assets
- pushing updates to your frontend
