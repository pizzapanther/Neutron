# What is GraphQL?

A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API.

---

# What is GraphQL?

- a new method to write APIs
- tool to develop a description of your data and what you can do
  - reduces development efforts
  - reduces bandwidth: ask for exactly what you want
  - reduces requests
- Alternatives: [Falcor](https://netflix.github.io/falcor/)

---

# Typical API Development Cycle

- Backend: Develop API
- Frontend: Use API but needs tweaks
- Backend: Modifies API
- Frontend: Happy but now requirements change
- Backend: Updates API again

---

# GraphQL Development Cycle

- Backend: Develop API
- Frontend: Use API as needed
- Backend: Change API when data changes

# Using GraphQL With Python

- http://graphene-python.org/

# Django GraphQL Example

```python
from deck.models import Deck, Card

class CardNode (DjangoObjectType):
  full_question = String(source='full_question')
  answer = String(source='answer')
  
  class Meta:
    model = Card
    filter_fields = ['modified', 'created']
    interfaces = (relay.Node, )
          
class DeckNode (DjangoObjectType):
  card_count = Int(source='card_count')
  owner_id = Int(source='owner_id')
  short_description = String(source='short_description')
  all_cards = relay.ConnectionField(CardConnection)
  
  def resolve_all_cards (self, args, context, info):
    return self.all_cards()
    
  class Meta:
    model = Deck
    interfaces = (relay.Node, )
    
class Query(AbstractType):
  all_decks = DjangoFilterConnectionField(DeckNode)
  all_cards = DjangoFilterConnectionField(CardNode)
```

# The Drawbacks

- harder to cache
- eats all your errors
- new project
  - bugs?
  - maybe doesn't have all the features you want yet
